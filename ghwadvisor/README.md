# GHWAdvisor: kinda like [cadvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)

GHWAdvisor is a simplistic reimplementation of cadvisor, but only for the [machine data](https://github.com/google/cadvisor/blob/master/info/v2/machine.go) and based as much as possible on [ghw](https://github.com/jaypipes/ghw)
